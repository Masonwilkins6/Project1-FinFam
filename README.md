FinFam: Finance for Families
LPL Financial – Internship Project

Developed a full-stack web application, FinFam, to provide financial advisors with a platform to connect not only with the primary account holder but also with their spouse. This enabled holistic financial planning and advice tailored to the entire family.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend); Python, Flask, PostgreSQL (backend).

Key Features:
-User registration, secure login, and server-side session management for multiple family members.

-Questionnaire functionality that stores and retrieves user answers for financial analysis.

-REST APIs for seamless frontend-backend communication.

-Followed an AGILE development process for iterative progress.

Challenges and Solutions:
Initially used client-side sessions, which proved inefficient for data storage and retrieval, prompting a switch to server-side sessions for querying user answers.
First experience creating a project of this scale, which required learning the connection between frontend and backend using REST APIs.

Future Plans: Intended to integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide real-time analysis of user questionnaire responses—an innovative feature not available in LPL Financial’s current solution.

Impact: The application closely aligned with a similar internal project at LPL Financial, demonstrating its relevance and potential value. The feature of analyzing user responses via an LLM would have added a unique layer of personalized financial insights.
