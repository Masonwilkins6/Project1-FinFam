This is my first deployed and full stack web application, made during my internship at LPL Financial.

This internship was 3 months long and while most interns were assigned a capstone project, I was not and had the option to choose what I wanted to focus my time on. For me I wanted to learn
the fundementals of HTML, CSS, JS, and how they connected and interacted with a backend, which in my case I used Python with the Flask Framework. While this project may not look the prett-
iest, I was able to learn a lot of valuable information and understand the front-end and backend better. 

During my Internship at LPL, I was on the Digital Innovation Labs team, where we did a combination of tasks not particularly coding involved at all, which is why, when given the option to
choose my capstone, I went with a project that I've never had experience with at all. At the time of this internship I had just finsished my sophmore year as a computer science student, 
and had completed various courses at home with react, js, python etc.. But I felt that I didnt retain any of the information. When developing this app I was able to focus on the learning
and core principles behind web applciations. I was able to set up a database using Postgresql, and query this data on my front end using REST.

All in all this experience was great, and I am proud of myself for taking on the challange where others did not.
